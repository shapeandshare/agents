# Agents Core Framework

The core framework provides foundational components and abstractions for building AI-powered agents. It includes base classes, contracts, utilities, and infrastructure components needed to create specialized agents. The framework is designed to support scalable, event-driven architectures with robust data persistence and vector storage capabilities.

The core framework is designed to be extended while maintaining consistency and reliability across different agent implementations.
